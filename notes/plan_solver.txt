

data structure thing: 
    Set of closed cells, with 2 values, a max and min number of mines in it



begin with a set for each numbered cell:
    a '4' with 6 closed cells around it would create a set of those 6 cells
    both the max and min values are set to 4 since the number tells us this exactly.


the goal:
    reduce / split these sets to have either:
        the min number of mines be equal to the number of cells: they are all mines
        the max number of mines be 0: they are all safe



for every set:   
    for every other set:      lets label them A and B 

        note every time we update max or min we want to check we dont lose info
        the max cant increase and the min cant decrease, all values must be between 0 and 8

        consider 3 sets from this:
            the intersection, cells in both
            the 2 original sets subtract this intersection - lets call them cut sets


        min and max of cut sets to be their original big sets values
        intersections min to be 0 and max to be 8
        ###

        calculate improved min for intersection:
            for each cut set, take the number of cells it has,
                from this, subtract its min, the result is the number of mines it is 
                forcing into the intersection
                so do this calculation for both the cut sets, the LARGER one is the min of intersection

        improve max for cut sets:
            take the max of the original big set, from this, subtract the min of the intersection
            the result is the most (max) mines that can be in that cut set, update its max

        improved max for intersection:
            the smaller of the 2 maxs from each of the original sets

        improved min for cut set
            for each original set:
                take its min number of mines, from this, subtract the max of the intersection
                this becomes the cut sets minimum

        again, NEED checks that these values do not go below 0 or above 8
