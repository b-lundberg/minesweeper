# Wilf Waldron/AosUK's Minesweeper solver rewritten in C

Inspired by [his video](https://youtu.be/n04aEKL-5lw).

Files in `textures/*` and `notes/*` are copied from
[his repo](https://github.com/AosUK/aosuk.github.io/tree/main/MS).

I decided to copy instead of forking because:
 - AosUK put this stuff in his .github.io instead of a separate repo,
   forking would be inelegant.
 - I only use `notes/*` as references, version control is unnecessary.
 - `textures/*` is just a bunch of PNGs.

*Conceptually* it probably should have been a fork however.
